# meteor-typeahead [![Build Status][buildstatus]][buildstatusurl]

### Twitter's [typeahead.js](http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/) autocomplete package, wrapped for Meteor

This is a thin wrapper around `typeahead`, and requires the collection to reside entirely on the client. Fetching results from the server should be pretty simple but depends on your use case - have a look [here](https://github.com/sergeyt/meteor-typeahead/issues/4).
